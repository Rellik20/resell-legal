- Do not share sensitive information in chat.
- Inspect items before paying.
- Use safe payment methods and never pay in advance to unknown parties.

We may, at any time and in our sole discretion:
- Remove or restrict content
- Hide listings
- Suspend, disable, or terminate accounts
- Limit messaging

We are not obligated to monitor all content, but we may review content and messages when necessary for safety, abuse prevention, policy enforcement, and legal compliance.
