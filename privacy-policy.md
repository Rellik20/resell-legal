# Privacy Policy (ReSell)

Effective date: 2026-02-13

This Privacy Policy explains how ReSell (“ReSell,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the ReSell mobile application (the “App”).

If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, do not use the App.

---

## 1) What ReSell is
ReSell is a local marketplace app that lets users create listings with photos and message other users. ReSell does not process payments or shipping. Any transaction happens between users.

---

## 2) Information we collect

### A) Information you provide
- **Account information:** email address and a password (stored as a **hashed** password, not plain text).
- **Listings:** title, description, price, photos you upload, and a public location label (City/State).
- **Messages:** messages you send through the in-app chat.
- **Support requests / reports:** if you contact us, we receive the content you send (including reports about listings or users).

### B) Location information
ReSell uses location to show nearby listings and to attach a **City/State** label to your listing:
- If you tap **Use Current Location**, we collect your device location to set listing coordinates.
- If you type a City/State and “Set from Search,” we derive coordinates from that location.
- **Other users do not see your exact coordinates.** They see only the City/State label you provide.

### C) Automatically collected data
We may collect basic technical data for security and reliability, such as:
- approximate device/network information (e.g., IP address)
- app events (crash logs, error logs)
- timestamps and identifiers needed to run the service

---

## 3) How we use information
We use information to:
- create and manage your account
- create, display, and manage listings
- enable messaging between users
- show listings by distance (nearby discovery)
- prevent abuse, enforce safety rules, and investigate reports
- maintain service security, reliability, and performance

---

## 4) How we share information

### A) With other users (public/visible in the app)
- Your **listing details** (title, description, price, photos)
- Your **public location label** (City/State)
- Messages are visible to the conversation participants

We do not display your exact GPS coordinates to other users.

### B) With service providers
We use third-party vendors to operate the App (for example: image hosting, database hosting, and email delivery). These vendors process information only to provide services to us and are not allowed to use it for their own purposes.

### C) For legal and safety reasons
We may disclose information if we believe it is reasonably necessary to:
- comply with law or legal process
- protect users, prevent fraud/abuse, or address security issues
- enforce our Terms and Community Guidelines

---

## 5) Data retention
We keep information only as long as necessary to provide the App and for legitimate safety/security purposes.

If you delete your account (in-app), we delete your account data as described in the Account Deletion page, subject to any limited retention required for legal compliance or security.

---

## 6) Your choices

### A) Location permissions
You can deny location permission. You can still set a City/State manually for listings.

### B) Access, updates, and deletion
You can update or delete your account from within the App. See: **Account Deletion**.

---

## 7) Security
We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

---

## 8) Children’s privacy
ReSell is intended for users **18+** and is not directed to children. If you believe a minor has provided personal information, contact us and we will take appropriate steps.

---

## 9) Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Effective date” will show the latest version.
