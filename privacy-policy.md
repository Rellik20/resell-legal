# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** February 13, 2026  
**Operator:** Scott Cote (“ReSell”, “we”, “us”)  
**Contact:** resell21126@gmail.com

This Privacy Policy explains how ReSell collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you use the ReSell mobile application and related services (the “Service”).

## 1. Summary (plain language)

ReSell collects account information (email + password hash), listing content (photos, title, description, price), approximate location (City/State label), and private coordinates used for nearby discovery. ReSell also stores user-to-user messages and may review content when necessary to enforce safety and policies.

We do not sell your personal information.

## 2. Information we collect

### 2.1 Account information
- **Email address**
- **Password hash** (we do not store your plaintext password)
- Account metadata (created/updated timestamps)
- Account status flags (e.g., disabled) and role (user/admin)

### 2.2 Listings and user-generated content
- Listing title, description, price
- Listing photos you upload
- Listing status (active/sold)
- City/State location label shown to other users
- Creation/update timestamps

### 2.3 Location information
ReSell supports “nearby” discovery. Depending on how you set location, we may collect:
- **Private precise coordinates (latitude/longitude)** used to calculate distance and show nearby listings
- **Public City/State label** displayed to other users

**Privacy design:** Other users should only see your **City/State label**. ReSell does not display your exact coordinates to other users.

You can deny location permission and instead type a City/State manually.

### 2.4 Messaging data
- Messages you send and receive (text content)
- Message timestamps and read status
- Conversation metadata (last message preview and time)

### 2.5 Technical and security data
- Basic device/app information necessary to operate the Service (e.g., request metadata, error logs)
- IP address and basic request logs may be processed by infrastructure providers for security and reliability

## 3. How we use information

We use information to:
- Create and manage accounts
- Authenticate users and secure access
- Host and display listings
- Provide nearby discovery (distance-based listing feed)
- Deliver messaging functionality
- Prevent abuse, spam, fraud, and prohibited content
- Enforce Terms and Community Guidelines
- Maintain, debug, and improve the Service
- Comply with legal obligations and respond to lawful requests

## 4. How we share information

### 4.1 With other users
When you use the Service, some information is visible to other users:
- Your listing content (photos, title, description, price)
- Your **City/State label**
- Messaging content with the person you message

We do **not** intend to share your exact coordinates with other users.

### 4.2 With service providers (processors)
We use third-party providers to run the Service. These providers process data on our behalf, including:
- **Cloud storage / image hosting** for listing photos
- **Database hosting** for app data
- **Email delivery** for verification codes and password reset codes
- **Infrastructure and logging** for reliability and security

These providers are authorized to process data only as needed to provide services to ReSell.

### 4.3 For legal and safety reasons
We may disclose information if we believe it is necessary to:
- Comply with law, regulation, legal process, or government request
- Enforce our Terms or Community Guidelines
- Detect, prevent, or address fraud, security, or technical issues
- Protect the rights, property, or safety of ReSell, our users, or the public

### 4.4 Business changes
If ReSell is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to applicable law.

## 5. Content moderation and message review

ReSell may review listings and messages when reasonably necessary to:
- Investigate reports and abuse
- Enforce safety rules and prohibited content policies
- Respond to legal requests or credible safety threats

We do not promise proactive monitoring of all content, but we reserve the right to do so.

## 6. Data retention

We keep information for as long as needed to provide the Service and for legitimate business and legal purposes, including security and enforcement.

Typical retention:
- Account data is kept until you delete your account or it is removed for policy reasons.
- Listings and messages are kept until account deletion, unless needed longer for safety, fraud prevention, or legal obligations.

## 7. Account deletion

You can delete your account in the app. When you delete your account, ReSell will delete or de-identify data associated with your account, including:
- Your user account
- Your listings
- Listing images (best effort)
- Password reset and verification records
- Conversations and messages associated with your account (best effort)

Some limited information may be retained where required by law or for security and abuse prevention.

## 8. Your choices and controls

### 8.1 Location permissions
- You can deny location permission and manually enter a City/State.
- You can change location settings in your device settings.

### 8.2 Email communications
We send emails for account verification and password reset. If we introduce marketing emails in the future, we will provide opt-out choices as required by law.

## 9. Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your information. However, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 10. Children’s privacy

ReSell is intended for adults. Users must be **18+**. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 11. International use

ReSell is operated from the United States. If you use the Service from outside the U.S., you understand your information may be transferred to and processed in the U.S. and other countries where service providers operate.

## 12. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the effective date. Continued use of the Service after changes means you accept the updated policy.
