## Listing rules

All listings must:
- Be **truthful** and accurately describe the item, condition, and price
- Use **original photos** (or photos you have the right to use)
- Avoid misleading titles or keywords
- Avoid posting personal contact information in the listing text (use chat instead)

We may remove listings that are unsafe, prohibited, suspicious, misleading, or low-quality.

## Messaging rules

Messaging is for arranging a transaction safely. In chat, do not:
- Harass, threaten, or use hateful language
- Request or share sensitive personal data (banking, passwords, IDs, SSN, etc.)

We may review messages when needed to enforce safety and moderation, as described in our Privacy Policy.

## Safety tips for in-person transactions

ReSell is a platform for listings and messaging only. We do not process payments, shipping, refunds, or disputes. Users handle all transactions independently.

Recommended safety practices:
- Meet in a **public, well-lit place** (many communities offer “safe exchange zones”)
- Bring a friend when possible
- Use secure payment methods and confirm funds before handing over the item
- Trust your instincts and cancel if anything feels suspicious
- In emergencies, contact local emergency services immediately

---

## Reporting and support

If you see something that violates these guidelines, report it.

### How to report
Email: **resell21126@gmail.com**  
Subject: **ReSell Report**

Include as many details as possible:
- The user involved (email/username if visible)
- Listing title and any identifying details
- Screenshots (recommended)
- A short explanation of what happened
- If the issue occurred in chat, mention the conversation context and approximate time

If you believe there is an immediate threat to safety, contact local emergency services first.

## Enforcement and moderation

We may take any of the following actions when we believe content or behavior violates our rules or creates safety risk:

- Remove or hide listings
- Remove messages or restrict messaging features
- Limit account functionality
- Temporarily suspend or permanently disable accounts
- Preserve relevant records for safety and security purposes
- Cooperate with lawful requests from authorities where required

Enforcement may be based on user reports, moderator review, automated signals, or other safety checks. We can act even without notice when urgent safety risks exist.

## Repeat offenders

Accounts that repeatedly violate these rules may be permanently disabled. Severe violations (for example: threats of violence, sexual exploitation, illegal weapons, or child safety issues) may result in immediate removal and permanent account action.
