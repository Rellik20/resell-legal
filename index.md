## Key safety + compliance points

### User-generated content
Listings, photos, and messages are created by users. We may review and moderate content to keep the platform safe, including removing listings, restricting features, or disabling accounts.

If you see something unsafe, illegal, or abusive, contact us at **resell21126@gmail.com**.

### Prohibited items and behavior
ReSell is for lawful person-to-person resale only. Do not list or request anything illegal under **federal, state, or local law** (including controlled substances, weapons, stolen goods, counterfeit items, and explicit sexual content). Full details are in the [Community Guidelines](community-guidelines) and [Terms of Service](terms-of-service).

### Location privacy
To show nearby listings, ReSell stores an approximate listing location (coordinates), but the app displays only a **City/State label** to other users.

### Age requirement
ReSell is intended for **adults 18+**.

### Account deletion
Users can delete their account **in-app**. When deleted, we remove your account data and user content from our systems as described on the [Account Deletion](account-deletion) page.
