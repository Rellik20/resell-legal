# Account Deletion

**Last updated:** February 13, 2026

ReSell provides **in-app account deletion**. When you delete your account, we permanently delete your account and associated data as described below.

If you have trouble deleting your account in the app, you can also request deletion by email.

Once confirmed, your account deletion request is processed immediately.

## Request account deletion by email (backup option)

Email: **resell21126@gmail.com**  
Subject: **Account Deletion Request**

Please include:
- The **email address** used to create your ReSell account
- A short message confirming you want the account deleted (example: “Please delete my ReSell account.”)

We may ask for a minimal verification step to ensure the request is legitimate (for example, replying from the same email address used for the account).

## What may be retained

Even after deletion, limited information may remain in the following cases:

- **Legal obligations:** If we are required to retain certain records to comply with law, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, or protect users and the platform.
- **Backups and logs:** Residual copies may exist in encrypted backups or security logs for a limited period. These are not used to restore your account and are removed/overwritten on standard retention cycles.

ReSell does not sell personal data.

## Important notes
